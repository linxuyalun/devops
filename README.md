## Idea

Our idea is to build a platform which provides the main function. It can trigger an event via email to inform the user of the discount of commodity that they want. The basic procedure is as followed:
* register
* search commodities in taobao or jingdong with key words
* add commodities to listening list
* start listening
* send an email when get a discount

### Advantages
* no need to login jingdong or taobao
* integration of multiple electronic business platforms

## Cloud Native

Cloud native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.

These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.

This [doc](doc/cloud-native.md) gives you a really simple guide to devops by using cloud-native toolkits in practice.
